LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for learning from sequences of data. It is particularly effective at capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, which makes it useful for tasks such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Key Concepts of LSTM
### 1.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):

RNNs are a class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information about previous elements in the sequence.
Standard RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it difficult for them to learn long-term dependencies.

### 2. LSTM Architecture:

LSTM networks address the vanishing gradient problem by introducing a more complex unit structure that includes gates to control the flow of information.
An LSTM unit consists of three main gates: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate.


### 3. Gates in LSTM:

Input Gate: Controls how much of the new information from the current input should be added to the cell state.
Forget Gate: Determines how much of the previous cell state should be retained or forgotten.
Output Gate: Decides how much of the cell state should be output as the hidden state for the next time step.

### 4. Cell State:

The cell state is a key component of LSTM that carries information across different time steps. It is modified by the gates to retain or discard information as needed.
