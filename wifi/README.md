# Wireless Network Security Assessment Tools

This directory contains scripts for wireless network security assessment and testing. These tools are intended for **educational purposes and authorized testing only**.

## Tools Overview

1. **WiFi Scanner**
- Scans for nearby wireless networks
- Collects basic network information (SSID, signal strength, encryption type)
- Used for network diagnostics and site surveys

2. **Network Monitor**
- Monitors wireless traffic patterns
- Analyzes network performance
- Helps identify network congestion and interference

3. **Security Audit Tools**
- Tests network configuration
- Validates security settings
- Identifies potential vulnerabilities in authorized networks

4. **Network Analysis**
- Captures network authentication handshakes for security analysis
- Validates WPA/WPA2 implementation strength
- Tests authentication mechanisms on authorized networks
- Stores captured data in PCAP format for analysis

## Testing Methodology

1. **Preparation**
- Obtain written authorization
- Document network details
- Set up monitoring equipment

2. **Data Collection**
- Capture authentication handshakes
- Monitor network traffic patterns
- Record authentication attempts

3. **Analysis**
- Review captured packets
- Validate security protocols
- Test password strength
- Identify potential vulnerabilities

## Legal Notice

These tools should only be used:
- On networks you own
- On networks you have explicit written permission to test
- In compliance with local laws and regulations
- For educational and security research purposes

## Usage Requirements

- Valid network testing authorization
